Puard is a powershell command line tool to easily handle events on file system modifications.
It is inspired by the ruby tool called 'Guard' https://github.com/guard/guard

It will watch all file changes in a certain directory and send events to your code so you can respond to it.

To install add to your modules directory.

Then create a puardfile.ps1 in the directory you want to watch - you can look in the example.ps1 file in the repository.

To invoke Puard simply write Invoke-Puard in the commandline and it will watch the current directory using the puardfile...
